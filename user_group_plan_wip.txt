❯ /frontend-design I want the sidebar collapse/expand button to always be on the
 left. remove the current arrow and make the bubble icon the toggle, and make it
 switch to 3 bars when it's collapsed (to expand it) and the bubble when it's 
expanded (to collapse it). also change the "Budi Chat" title in the side bar to 
the user's name, and the part underneath have a flair with their user group 
(basically user groups  will be for organising users. types: "Guest", "User", 
"Admin"). please think of new privileges that could be toggled for each of these
 groups in the admin settings. Privileges/permissions should be edited per 
group, and admins can assign/edit user groups when adding/editing a user. 

● I'll explore the codebase to understand the current sidebar implementation,
  user management, and admin settings structure before planning these changes.

● Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the codebase. Let me read the key
  files to verify the details and then design the implementation plan.
